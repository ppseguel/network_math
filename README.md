**Contribution-roles in community-based question answering sites: The case of Mathoverflow**

Muffak, A. and Seguel P.

*In this research, we explore the patterns in how users engage in knowledge conversations within a community-based question answering sites (CQAs) through generative-roles based on their contribution patterns. Based on Mathoverflow data we identify the existence of generative-roles based on the ways that users contribute to the platform. Based on a network perspective, we built a  knowledge collaboration network that can be represented from the core knowledge sharing practices. Three main contribution-interactions are analyzed: the answer to a question (A2Q), comment to a question (C2Q), comment to an answer (C2A). Based on the analysis of the largest component, and node centralities we build measures of contribution-related roles. We start by analyzing ratios between centralities of different types of relationships to identify different nodes. Then, we explore the possible uses of these metrics and their limitations to explain exchanges within and across communities. Ideas for future research are discussed.*
